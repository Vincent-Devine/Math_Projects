## Quick Start ##
Unity project
1. Clone the project from git ``` git clone ```
2. Open the project
3. Open the scene ``` SampleScene ```
4. In the inspector of the ``` Plane ```, you can change value of the map generation (values that can be tweaked: height of the peaks, scale of the noise, position of the plane, size of the map)

## How it works ##
A 2D array of float is generated with Mathf.PerlinNoise included in Unity.
This array is converted to a Texture2D.
A grid mesh is generated of the size of the texture.
The grayscale of the texture is then used to generate the height of the mesh peaks.
