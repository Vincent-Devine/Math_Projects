# Project Fluid Mechanics

**Group :DEVINE Vincent, GOUPIL Kristian and LISE Omaya**

For ISART Digital
<hr /><br />

## **Project description :**
The goal of this project is to use our own physic function to simulate the flow of a fluid. Although we wil we using Unity we will not be using its collision system.<br /> The created two simulation : the first one show the flow from a water tower of a perfect fluid, the second one (more accurate from a physic point of view) simulate the flow of a fluid accounting for its viscosity.


## **To build and run the project :** 
Use the build (launch the .exe) or open the project in Unity.
<br /><hr />

## **UI:** 
F1 : go to scene 1<br />
F2 : go to scene 2

First scene buttons allow to modify : 
- the height of the water tower (m)
- the volumic mass (kg/m3)
- the diameter of the hole from which the liquid is flowing
- The pressure on the liquid
- To refill the tank

## **ATTENTION :** 
- Time is slowed in our second scene 

Second scene buttons allow to modify : 
- the mass of the particle (g)
- the viscosity
